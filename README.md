QuadMind - AI assisted meshing
==============================

This project is being used to investigate the application of machine learning techniques to the problem of generating unstructured finte element meshes.  As a start, [Karl Levik's Java implementation](https://github.com/KarlLevik/qmorph) of the Qmorph algorithm has been ported to c++.  Debugging is in process.
